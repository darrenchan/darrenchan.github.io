ops-guide
~~~~~~~~~
 https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/PAO-ops-ops-guide-fixing
upgrades- work under different conditions, so the need to make it more generic.

Organising by services?

HA too much configuration detail, more abstract and conceptual information.
Don't document running supporting services like HAproxy etc.

Managing the cloud lifecycle
Troubleshooting out of date
Define
HP operations don't troubleshoot

Action:
Define the tasks operators want documented
Source downstream ops info to share upstream
email ops guide team on

Takeaways:
Share information upstream
Categorising information by persona causes duplication of information and makes information hard to find.
engaging with operators
Document real world experiences and what happens in production

Mitaka - Beyond the release notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Meet the OpenStack Personas (So Far)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Slide deck: https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B9N3-Cxg0tC7RDdjbnRkeFZ3eWs&usp=drive_web

- Personas help the community understand who are our users

- Personas are representations of your key audience segments based on qualitative
  and quantitative user research

- Personas ARE important to developers, to validate assumptions how users use
  your products, or features and determine user role,s error messages, terminology, results

- Persona validation survey conducted at Rackspace, IBM Design in Austin and Best Buy in Seattle

Roles in the Cloud Ecosystem
----------------------------
- Hardware- DC ops
- Cloud OS (service provider)- Service Admin, Automation Engineer, Clouds Ops,
  Infra Architect
- Domain - Domain Ops
- Application - App Arch, Project Owner, App Developer


Lead developer - managing users and policies
Domain Ops - in managed providers, managed SLAs. troubleshooting,

- Roles at Different Cloud Adoption Stages (see slide deck)

Roles differs across Adopters and Ecosystems
---------------------------------------------
Enterprise - security and compliance with regulations, formal roles
Service provider - provide service to customer, security and hiding data
between customers, high reliability, compliance inherited from customer's needs
Research/Academic - flexible architecture, minimal compliance

OpenStack UX vision
-------------------
- Operator feedback was isolation lack of coordination between projects.
  For example, terminology 'project 'or 'tenant'?
- Drive consistency in how we talk about our customers within the community
- This includes the OS Foundation, User Committes, Product WG, OpenStack UX, Project
  Encourage discussion of personas in projects
- Validate personas


The Big Tent - One year later
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

What is it?

Projects moved from stack forge into an official projects

Benefits
--------
- no longer stuck  - using governance to drive behaviour
- More collaboration between projects
- More reactivity - ideas are driven by users and operators and allowed creating of team
- Competition - mechanisms to adding multiple projects to address the same problem
- Forced us to document the OpenStack way - project team guide
- Focus on the core infra

Disadvantages
-------------
- Some projects are single vendor and remain that way.

- Confusion between what we produce
  It can be hard  for an established project to join OpenStack because of the
  governance requirements. For example, drop tools (e.g mailing list) and
  resources that works and is successful.

Ugly

Cleaning up the tent


From Upstream Documentation To Downstream Product Knowledge Base
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Using Zendesk for support knowledge base content
Headings be more descriptive for SEO

================
Tuesday 26 April
================

Getting API docs off WADL and into RST
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/newton-api-docs-rst

- fairy slipper generated website from swagger
- nova response requests are in the source tree, use testing samples
- parameters in yaml files
- Encourage projects to adopt best practices

HPE - Lifecycle Management of OpenStack using Ansible
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Deploy, reconfig, upgrade/upstre./hotfix, Add service to node, add/remove ode, offline/online nodes


Conforming complexity - The number one barrier to enterprise adoption
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- April 2016 User Survey Report
  Complexity - many choices to be made
  54 OpenStack projects

- Deployment considerations - OS, OpenStack

- Network configuration - flat, vlans, GRE tunnel, SDN

- Getting started with OpenStack page (7 options) vs Microsoft azure (1 option)

- Complexities - management

Address complexities
Docs -
User feedback

fleet and inventory management

Installation Guide discussion
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- docs - revamping the install guide

- Need for comparison of deployment tools such as Fuel, ansible, etc to allow users to make a choice

- Each deployment has a reference architecture

OpenStack Talent Development - Lessons Learned
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Community - embracing rookies
  An exam to measure the effectiveness of learning.

- Teaching new developers to embrace the community culture and understand how
  to commit code, do code reviews, have a high degree of collaboration.

- Best way to learn is to teach it. All students will be adhoc professors and
   teach what they learned.
- Implemeent project deep dives
- Run classes to support technologies

OpenStack upgrades
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Isolation is important for rollbacks
- QA is invaluable after testing upgrade
- Co-gating jobs will test for each service
- Control plane
- open window for customers to test

Why is it a problem for customers to upgrade to current releases?
- Upgrades are hard, lose connectivity for a period of time
- We don't necessarily need new features, hence don't upgrade
nova

- 45 minutes for database migration
- no planning necessary with Cola container
- How long does it take to do upgrade? Outage? Control plane changes is not
  outage time.
